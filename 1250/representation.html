# Outline

* Anxiety and celebration (old traditions and new)

*Note: this material comes out of an article:*

Feld, Steven. 2000. “A Sweet Lullaby for World Music.” *Public Culture* 12 (1): 145–71.

# World music as an industry

* What are we selling? What are we buying?
	* Role of marketing, listeners
* Who are the markets?
	* Role of migration

---

# World music as an industry

* Middle of the 20th century: "third world music" was primative, exotic, tribal, ethnic, folk, traditional, international
	* Linked to academia (ethnomusicology was a new field, folklore studies has a longer history)

# World music as an industry

* 1990s: International artists gain recognition on their own by following the logic of Western pop
	* Some degree of "curation" still applied (think of Ry Cooder's *Buena Vista Social Club* or Micky Hart's *Planet Drum*)
	* From Feld: "danceable ethnicity and exotic alterity" (151)
* Examples include The Chieftains, Ladysmith Black Mambazo, The Gipsy Kings, and Zap Mama

### How can music represent difference?

### How does musical diversity create (or remove) difference?

# Anxieties and Celebrations

## Celebrations

* Sean Barlow and Banning Eyre: an "endlessly creative conversation" between "local roots and international pop culture"
* Normalizing globalization (like what happens with modernization narratives)

---

# Anxieties and Celebrations

## Anxieties

* Viet Erlmann notes a "coating the sounds of the fully commodified present with the patina of use value in some other time and place"
* The cost of globalization: unequal work and exploitive finances
	* Not unique to "world music": these issues were rampant in America's early music industry
* Ashwani Sharma:
	* "'musical and cultural conversation' validated under the sign of World Music too easily mask the exploitative labour relationship of the very powerful transnational corporations with the 'Third World' musicians, let alone with those of the Third World with only their photogenic poverty to sell"

# Sweet Lullaby

* 1973: UNESCO releases an LP recorded by Hugo Zemp, an ethnomusicologist
	* *Solomon Islands: Fateleka and aegu Music from Malaita*
	* Includes a lullaby called "Rorogwela," sung by Afunakwa
	* Primarily used by ethnomusicologists interested in the Pacific Islands

### Deep Forest: "Sweet Lullaby"
]

---

# Sweet Lullaby

* In liner notes to a 1995 *Deep Forest* album (which won a Grammy):
	* Described how they use "native melodies" as "raw material, an opportunity to cross and blend"
* Referencing that earlier album in the liner notes:
	* "*Deep Forest* is the respect of this tradition which humanity should cherish as a treasure which marries world harmony, a harmony often compromised today. That's why the musical creation of *Deep Forest* has received the support of UNESCO and of two musicologists, Hugo Zempe [sic] and Shima [sic] Aron [sic], who collected the original documents."
* The song and others from the album appear in commercials for Neutrogena, Coca-Cola, Porsche, Sony, and The Body Shop

---

# Some important notes...

* Hugo Zemp wrote an article in 1996 protesting the album

--

* He was told by UNESCO that Deep Forest wanted to sample one of his other recordings (from Africa) for a project honoring Earth Day

--

* He refused after listening to an extract over the phone and encouraged UNESCO to support projects that "more directly benefit indigenous musics and musicians"

--

* A fellow scholar (Francis Bebey) urged him to reconsider and he did ("After all, I thought, it was for a justifiable aim")

--

* He then found out that Deep Forest used samples from an African recording in another series without license. They paid an out-of-court settlement to the producers

---

# Some important notes...

* So, after seeing the recording's success and fielding questions from colleauges about his "advertised complicity in *Deep Forest*," Zemp got the CD

--

* And he didn't hear any of his African recordings! But "Rorogwela" was there, which he was never asked about

--

* Then he heard it in a shampoo commercial on French TV and reached out to UNESCO and Bebey (the scholar)

--

* He looked back at correspondance and found that (1) Bebey was likely misled about the nature of the recording, (2) UNESCO never confirmed that he had changed his mind, and (3) the Pacific Islands recordings had never been approved anyhow

---

# Some important notes...

* Remember that section of the liner notes?
	* "*Deep Forest* is the respect of this tradition which humanity should cherish as a treasure which marries world harmony, a harmony often compromised today. That's why the musical creation of *Deep Forest* has received the support of UNESCO and of two musicologists, Hugo Zempe [sic] and Shima [sic] Aron [sic], who collected the original documents."

---

# And guess what happens next!

* Jan Garbarek, Norwegian saxophonist, hears "Rorogwela" on *Deep Forest* and assumes that it's from Central Africa (since *Deep Forest* did not give sources)

--

* So he titles his acoustic adaptation "Pigmy Lullaby." Liner notes call it an "African melody, arranged by Jan Garbarek"
	* He reharmonizes it into a smooth jazz hymnody of sorts (to borrow Feld's words)

--

* And then get this! He's called out for it on the radio—which turns into a big thing—but the radio host says that the original is from Samoa, not the Solomon Islands
