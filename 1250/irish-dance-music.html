	* Home to 6 million people, 70+ million in diaspora
* Northern Ireland (“The Troubles”)
	* Violent struggle between Protestant majority (two thirds) and Catholic minority (one third)
	* Terrorism, conflicts about British control, with Britain
	* British martial law, at its worst in the 70s and 80s
* Bloody Sunday: Jan 30, 1972

# Irish nationalism

* Unlike Northern Ireland…
	* Largely Catholic (93%)
	* Independent since 1949, previously “Irish Free State”
	* Rapid emigration, especially during different periods
	* Led to substantial (and important) diaspora
* Authenticity questions…
	* Imagined Ireland, tourism, “Irish Eyes are Smiling”

# Irish traditional music

* World famous artists…
	* Are they examples of traditional music?
	* How so? Why not?
* What is their image of Irish-ness?
	* How does that align with what you think of?

---

# Irish traditional music

* Five main categories
	* Sean nós, or “old way” songs (Irish Gaelic)
	* Irish harp music (harp is a national symbol)
	* Instrumental airs (often in free rhythm)
	* Songs sung in English
	* Instrumental dance tunes and medleys (our focus)

# 1970s, another revival...

* Second generation of Irish music revival
* New generation of Irish musicians who
	* Grew up with other music: rock, jazz, classical
	* Fused these with Irish traditional music
	* Carried on songs, dance tunes, and performance traditions of Irish forebears
	* Often had close relationships with the older musicians (e.g., Seamus Ennis and Planxty piper Liam O’Flynn)
* Iconic bands
	* Planxty, Clannad, Bothy Band, De Danaan, Horslips

# 1970s, another revival...

* "Modern" sound through instrumentation...
	* Combining traditional and chordal accompaniments
	* Chordal instruments include guitar, Irish bouzouki and others—stylistic elements from jazz, rock, flamenco
	* Drums, other percussion instruments (e.g., conga)
* ...and other influences
	* Traditional rhythms (like the reel) enhanced by jazz, rock, Latin, African, Balkan rhythms
* But, increasing separation of dance tunes from dancing…
	* Though dance revivals also appeared in theatrical productions like Riverdance
