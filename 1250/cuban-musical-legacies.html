* During the 20s, however, son rivals the danzón
	* Increased use of conga, afro-cuban drumming
	* Sexteto Habanero “La Loma De Belén”
	* Formed in 1918, working class, “put son in a tuxedo”

Round the corner of the old neighborhood I saw him go, <br />
with the familiar gait that street toughs have. <br />
His hands always deep inside the pockets of his coat, <br />
so that nobody knows which one holds the dagger. <br />
 <br />
He sports a wide-brimmed hat, tilted to one side, <br />
and sneakers, to fly when in danger. <br />
Dark shades so nobody knows what he's staring at, <br />
and a golden tooth that shines when he laughs. <br />
 <br />
Three blocks away from that corner, a woman <br />
strides the entire sidewalk for the fifth time, <br />
and goes into a tenement hallway to take a swig and forget <br />
that it's a slow day, and there are no clients to service. <br />
 <br />
A car passes very slowly down the avenue. <br />
It has no markings but everyone knows it's the police. <br />
Pedro Navaja, his hands always inside his coat, <br />
looks and smiles, and his gold tooth shines again. <br />

<audio controls="controls">
	<source src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Pedro Navaja.m4a" type="audio/mpeg">
</audio>

---

While walking he looks from corner to corner, <br />
Not a soul is seen, all the avenue is deserted, <br />
when this woman suddenly leaves the hallway, <br />
and Pedro Navaja clenches his fist inside his overcoat. <br />
 <br />
He looks at both sides and doesn't see anyone, <br />
and running, silently, he crosses the street, <br />
and meanwhile that woman is on the other side, <br />
grumbling because she didn't make money for food. <br />
 <br />
As she walks, she draws a revolver from her old coat, that woman, <br />
to put it inside her purse, so it won't hinder her. <br />
A .38 Smith and Wesson Special <br />
that she keeps always, to rid her from all evil. <br />
 <br />
And Pedro Navaja, knife in hand, jumped on her, <br />
the gold tooth lighting up the entire avenue, how easy! <br />
Laughing, he stabbed her without compassion, <br />
when suddenly a shot sounded, like a cannon. <br />
 <br />
And Pedro Navaja fell on the sidewalk, as he saw that woman, with <br />
the revolver in her hand, mortally wounded, telling him: <br />
"I thought, 'today is not my day, I'm on a bad streak,' <br />
but Pedro Navaja, you are worse, you are nothing." <br />
 <br />

---

And believe me, guys, even though noise was made, nobody came out, <br />
nobody was curious, no questions were asked, nobody cried. <br />
Just a drunk who found the two bodies, <br />
Took the revolver, the knife, the money, and left, <br />
 <br />
And stumbling, he went along singing, out of tune, <br />
the chorus I've brought you, which carries the message of my song: <br />
"Life brings you surprises, surprises are brought by life, oh God." <br />
Life brings you surprises, surprises are brought by life, oh God <br />
 <br />
Pedro Navaja, killer on the corner, "he who lives by the sword, dies by the sword" <br />
Life brings you surprises, surprises are brought by life, oh God <br />
Bad-ass fisherman, you cast a bad [fishing] line, <br />
Instead of a sardine, you caught a shark <br />
 <br />
**Montuno Section (Repeated phrases including:)** <br />
There are eight million stories in New York City <br />
As my grandma said, "he who laughs last, laughs best." <br />
When destiny is written, not even iron will can change it <br />
If you were born to be a hammer, nails rain down from heaven. <br />
In the neighborhood of tough guys, be careful on the sidewalk <br />
Take care, my buddy, he who does not run, flies. <br />
As in a Kafka novel, the drunkard turned at the corner. <br />
