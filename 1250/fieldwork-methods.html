	* Introduce yourself and your project
	* As for permission if you are recording
	* Let the person across from you talk
	* Ask for clarification
	* Summarize his or her points to be sure that you understand
	* Keep it open-ended… you don’t know where your fieldwork will take you!

# Recording

* Ask permission!
* Think about how people will answer (and structure their answers)
	* How can you ask a better question?
	* Can you get stories instead of "Yes" or "No"?
* Think about the sounds you hear
	* Life is louder on a recording than in person
* Equipment
	* Phone apps do some odd things with sound
	* GarageBand might work, test your phone first
	* Library circulation desk has recorders
