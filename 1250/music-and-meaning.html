---

# Ethnomusicology

* Studying music in and as culture
	* How do music and culture interact?
	* Does one build the other?
	* Do they reinforce each other?
	* How do people use music, and how does music influence people?
* The field of study
	* Interdisciplinary research methods
	* Tools from anthropology, musicology, music theory, other social and hard sciences

---

# Culture

* Edward Taylor’s “Complex whole...” 1871
	* Art, knowledge, morals, customs, etc.
	* Habits: what people do, why
* But, we’re all so different
	* Where are the lines?
	* Geographic levels of culture: family, neighborhood, city, state, region, nation
	* Overlapping cultures: banjo player, funk bassist, researcher, musicologist, teacher, Falcon, Gator, dog owner, beer snob turned whiskey drinker, father...

---

# Music and meaning

* Part of belief systems, childhood, commercial activity
	* Song can gain meaning with little change
	* Ray Charles: Sunday morning to Saturday night

# Music and meaning

* Part of belief systems, childhood, commercial activity
	* Song can gain meaning with little change
	* Ray Charles: Sunday morning to Saturday night
* Learning to understand meaning
	* Background or training may be required
	* Think about listening to classical music: it takes patience and training to “get” certain aspects
	* Importance of listening skills

---

# Identity

* How does music define who you are? How does it portray that?

	* Can guide you into a “subculture”
	* Demonstrates your inclusion, along with dress, language, politics, behaviors

* Importance of this interaction

	* Part of a group and shows your association
	* Yet: can create misleading stereotypes
	* Yet: builds some unexpected (creative) contradictions
	* Example: “traditional” vs. “modern”

---

# Nationalism

* Nations vs. Nation-states?

--
* Nation-states

	* Clear government, land
	* Unified by ideals (though not always)

* Nations

	* May lack land, clear government
	* Potentially dispersed, though unified
	* Nation of Islam, Palestinian nation…

* Music’s role in national identity

	* Part of specific projects, but meaning can change
	* Anthems, protest songs, for or against governments

### Jimi Hendrix: "Star Spangled Banner" (Woodstock, 1969)

---

# Diasporas

* Kinda like nations, but geographically dispersed

	* There is a homeland, but the community is not there (Palestine, Jewish communities)

* Major examples

	* Jewish communities exiled or put into Eastern European ghettos
	* African populations transplanted through slavery

* Brings groups together

	* Communities may work to build new identities, may hold onto old ones

---

# Individuality

* Groups help for understanding connections, organization

	* Yet: it is people who do the creating, listening, participating

* Intersectionality

	* Overlapping individual identities
	* Complex negotiations with the world around us

* Social structures help, but we are just ourselves in the end

---

# Traditions

* What is tradition?

	* What does “traditional” mean?
	* Who decides?

--
* What about:

	* Hank Williams or other older country?

# Traditions

* Common meaning

	* Something entrenched, static
	* The way it was, the past

* Our take

	* Maintaining cohesive artistic, social, cultural values
	* Constant state of change
	* Often referential to the past, but can sound modern

* Tradition lies within the importance of continuity
