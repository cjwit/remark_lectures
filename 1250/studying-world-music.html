# Why are we here?

* Why is it important?
	* Diversity of approaches to universal questions
	* Patiently comprehending the unfamiliar
	* Listening emotionally, intellectually, and physically
* Real life applications!
	* Migration, globalization… And so much great music
* What can we learn?
	* About others, about ourselves?
	* Finding familiarity, experiencing music, “musicking”

# Limits to a geographical focus

* Everything happens everywhere
	* Tradition and change
	* Nostalgia, folklore, representation
	* Globalization
	* Politics
	* Economics

* Mix of musical content, history, other social themes throughout
