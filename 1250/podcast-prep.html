# Audio editing with Audacity

* Free, open source audio editing software
* Because it's open source, it is a bit complex to set up (these licensing issues keep it free)
* There are other options and all of them work pretty similarly
* Vocab here will help you know what to look for when learning something else if you choose to go that way

### Download Audacity

1. Go to [https://sourceforge.net/projects/audacity/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/audacity/) and click "Download"
2. Install the software...

---

# Intalling libraries

We need two, we install them through the Library pane of Audacity's preferences

.image-float-right[.image-60[![prefs]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/audacity-2.png)]]

<div style="clear:both">
Click "Download" for each of these and follow the steps (photos on the next page)
</div>

# FFmpeg

Follow the links and directions

and...

The MP3 one works similarly, but we'll skip that for now. Audacity will hopefully locate your files auto-magically.

---

# Drag and drop a file to import

* You'll need the mp3 library working to use mp3 files
* You can also record using the red "Record" button

---

# Add some royalty-free music

* Search SoundCloud, Free Music Archive ([freemusicarchive.org](http://freemusicarchive.org), click "Genres")
* You'll need some voice and some music for the first assignment
* Import the music in the same way you did the voice

---

# That's more music than we need...

# Saving

* Let's save... The warning tells you that the audio files are not part of the main file, so don't move them around! (You can save some frustration later by organizing your audio files in a folder before starting to work with Audacitiy)
* If you don't, and then you move your files around, the program will not be able to find them and you'll have to start over

---

# Getting around

* Playing, stopping, getting back to the beginning
* Three main tools: selection, time shift, envelope

.center[.image-50[![prefs]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/audacity-7.png)]]

* Zooming in and out

.center[.image-30[![prefs]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/audacity-8.png)]]

---

# Cutting

* Find the section you like by clicking around and hitting play (remember, you only need 30 seconds for this first assginment)
* Then pick what you don't want and hit "Delete," it works just like a word processor (kinda)

---

# The "Time Shift" tool

.center[.image-40[![prefs]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/audacity-10.png)]]

* Get the voice out of the way while we fade in and out

# Fades

* Beginning and end

# Envelope
