# Audio editing with Audacity

* Free, open source audio editing software
* Because it's open source, it is a bit complex to set up (these licensing issues keep it free)
* There are other options and all of them work pretty similarly
* Vocab here will help you know what to look for when learning something else if you choose to go that way

### Download Audacity

1. Go to [https://sourceforge.net/projects/audacity/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/audacity/) and click "Download"
2. Install the software...

---

# Intalling libraries

We install two libraries through the "Library" pane of Audacity's preferences

You can find them through the "Download" button in the "Library" pane of Audacity's preferences

Get to preferences through the "Audacity" menu on a Mac or the "Edit" menu on Windows. .small-text[*(Note that this picture shows my screen, which already has the libraries installed. Yours will look different.)*]

# Installing libraries

The libraries are free and online. You can get to them in two ways. Download, open, and install the libraries:

**Mac:** Get [LAME here](https://lame.buanzo.org/Lame_Library_v3.99.5_for_Audacity_on_macOS.dmg) and get [FFmpeg here](https://lame.buanzo.org/ffmpeg-mac-2.2.2.dmg)

**Windows:** Get [LAME here](https://lame.buanzo.org/Lame_v3.99.3_for_Windows.exe) and get [FFmpeg here](https://lame.buanzo.org/ffmpeg-win-2.2.2.exe)

.small-text[*Two notes:*

*These are open source tools that may get flagged as viruses. To my knowledge, they are safe. They are industry standards. But, if you are uncomfortable with using them, you are welcome to find another audio editor. GarageBand is free and easy on a Mac, but Windows does not have a particularly simple free option to my knowledge. You may need to pay a bit or use a computer lab around campus.*

*If the links are outdated or broken, click "Download" for each of these and follow the steps (photos on the next page). Do me a favor and let me know so that I can fix them.*]

# Installing libraries

Go back to your Audacity preferences, click "Libraries" and hopefully Audacity has auto-magically found LAME and FFmpeg. **If not, try restarting the program and looking again.**

Here's my screen again, which has everything set up. Yours should look similar.

### Let's get some sound to work with

---

# Getting audio into Audacity

* If you have a built-in microphone, you can record using the red "Record" button
* Click record, talk for ten seconds, then hit the square "Stop" button

.center[.image-50[![prefs]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/audacity-3.png)]]

---

# Getting audio into Audacity

## Finding royalty-free music

* Some Podcast Prep assignments require music under an interview or voiceover. Luckily, there are some good resources out there.
* Search SoundCloud, Free Music Archive ([freemusicarchive.org](http://freemusicarchive.org), click "Genres")
* Poke around until you find something you like, then download it
* Once it's on your computer, create a new folder for this project and move the audio file there (Audacity doesn't organize things itself, so this step will save you a headache later)

---

# Getting audio into Audacity

## Importing audio (like royalty-free music)

* Drag the audio file from the new folder into the Audacity window.
* It will create a new "track" under the audio that you recorded a moment ago.
* Your screen should (might?) look like what's on the next page...

---

# That's more music than we need...

.center[.image-100[![prefs]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/audacity-4.png)]]

---

# Saving

* Let's save...
* This is the first one, so you can use "Save Project" or "Save Project As" or whatever similar commands show up on Windows
* The warning tells you that the audio files are not part of the main file, so don't move them around! This is important and it's why we made a folder for our project. If everything isn't in the same place, we might move a file and lose all of our work. **Keep things together in single folder.**
* When it asks where to save, find that same folder and save your project there

### Now, to find our way around

---

# Getting around: play

.center[.image-60[![prefs]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/audacity-5.png)]]

* Use your cursor to select anywhere on the audio file. It may be easiest to pick a random spot in the music.
* Hit "Play" and you'll hear the music (top left). The button changes to "Pause." Hitting it again stops the sound.
* You can use your space bar to play and pause, too.

---

# Getting around: to the beginning

.center[.image-60[![prefs]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/audacity-5.png)]]

* Now, try hitting the "Skip to beginning" button (it looks like two left-facing triangles pointing toward a line)
* Hit "Play" again (or push the space bar) and you'll hear your track from the beginning. This should have some music and maybe you'll hear some of your recorded voiceover.

---

# Getting around: zooming

.center[.image-50[![prefs]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/audacity-6.png)]]

* Click the simple zoom in and out buttons a few times. Notice that it zooms in on wherever your cursor (the long vertical line) is.
* Click the zoom button on the right, which shows you the entire project... I bet your voice over will be super tiny and hard to see: like this (next page)

---

# Zoomed all the way out

.center[.image-100[![prefs]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/audacity-4.png)]]

---

# Getting around: zooming

.center[.image-50[![prefs]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/audacity-6.png)]]

* Try selecting a section and using the zoom to selection button (the third of the four zoom buttons, it's greyed out in this picture but will show up when you select something)
* Go back to the whole project (the fourth button)

---

# Getting around: zooming

.center[.image-50[![prefs]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/audacity-7.gif)]]

* Try this: click the "Skip to beginning button"
* You can select by holding Shift while clicking, just like you can in a word document: hold Shift and click somewhere. .small-text[*Note: Windows may use something other than Shift.*]
* This lets you zoom using the zoom to selection button, but it gets the very beginning of the project

### Let's do some editing

---

# Cutting

* Find the section of your music file that you like by clicking around and hitting play or the space bar. .small-text[*(Remember, you only need 30 seconds for this first assginment)*]
* Then pick what you don't want and hit "Delete." .small-text[*(May be different on Windows)*]
* You can also use Shift: **hold Shift**, and hit the "Skip to end" button, then hit delete. Don't forget to hold Shift! .small-text[*Or just drag to select what you want to delete.*]

.center[.image-100[![prefs]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/audacity-8.gif)]]

---

# Moving audio around

* There are three main tools that we'll use: selection, time shift, envelope
* Click the "Time shift" tool (it looks like an arrow with two points, or maybe a dumbell?)

.center[.image-50[![prefs]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/audacity-9.png)]]

---

# The "Time Shift" tool

* If you haven't yet, use the zoom buttons to get your whole project on the screen
* Then pick the "Time Shift" tool and you can drag your (short) voiceover to where you want to line it up against the (longer) musical background.
