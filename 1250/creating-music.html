# Music as commodity

* Economic realities of music
	* Professional vs. non-professional musicians, specialization and expertise
	* Global economic pressures, aesthetic influences
	* Changing tastes of listeners
	* Buying and selling sounds
* Ownership issues
	* Communal vs. individual creativity
	* Questions of control, especially in small communities
* Musical change

---

# Production and reception

* Not always a clear line
	* Professional performer and paying audience member
	* What if a performer is alone?
	* If the audience is clapping? Singing?
* Reception and transfer of musical knowledge and experience
	* Learning via lessons or books?
	* Preserving music to memory or written sheet music?
	* These are changing: banjo players and tabs, classical violinists listening for style

---

# Creating music

* Composition
	* Planned ahead of time
	* Can be by an individual (composer) or a group (a band, for example)
* Improvisation
	* Spontaneous creation
	* Based in highly developed and practiced systems
	* Not just jazz!
	* Group improvisation (jamming)
* Neither has to be individual, nor is there always a clean line between them

---

# Creating music

* Arranging
	* Reworking an existing piece
	* New instrumentation, style, harmonies, texture, etc.
	* Also: like orchestration, building an ensemble piece out of basic components
* Interpretation
	* Performers and listeners make something their own
	* Levels of control between composers and performers regarding interpretation
* Thin line between these two
