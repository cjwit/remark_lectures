# Outline

* Single line textures
* Multiple line textures
* Formal structures
* Repetition and contrast

---

# Texture and form

* Texture
	* The relationships that emerge between different things you hear in music
	* Mostly, we will deal with the relationship between melodic lines and between melody and harmony
* Form
	* Large scale dimensions of musical organization
	* How pieces achieve coherence through repetition, patterns, variation, and development

---

# Single line textures

* Monophonic textures
	* Single line, by itself
	* Can be more than one instrument or singer

]

* Polyphonic textures
	* Multiple melodic (or musical, more generally) ideas
	* Rethink the Sufism example, remember the drums?
	* Possible on multiple voices or instruments, as well as within a single instrument (like piano, guitar)

---

# Multiple line textures

* Multiple melody textures
	* One or more essentially separate lines
	* BaMbuti Singing Group “Elephant Hunting Song”

* Polyrhythmic texture
	* Several distinct layers of rhythm
	* But is is polyrhythmic (think emic and etic…)
* Interlocking
	* Single melodic or rhythmic line divided amongst multiple instruments or voices
