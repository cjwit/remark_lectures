.left-half-column.small-text[
Alabama's gotten me so upset<br />
Tennessee made me lose my rest<br />
And everybody knows about<br />
Mississippi Goddam<br />
<br />
Can't you see it<br />
I know you can feel it<br />
It's all in the air<br />
I can't stand this pressure much longer<br />
Somebody say a prayer<br />
<br />
Hound dogs on my trail<br />
School children sitting in jail
]

.right-half-column.small-text[
Black cat cross my path<br />
I think every day's gonna be my last<br />
<br />
Lord have mercy on this land of mine<br />
We all gonna get it in due time<br />
I don't belong here<br />
I don't belong there<br />
I've even stopped believing in prayer<br />
<br />
Don't tell me, I tell you<br />
Me and my people just about due<br />
I've been there so I know<br />
They keep on saying "Go slow!"
