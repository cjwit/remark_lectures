# Egypt before, under, after colonialism

## Before colonialism

* Annexed by the Ottomans in 1516-17
  * al-Azhar in Cairo was a religious and education center
  * Gave authority across the region
* Conquered by Napoleon in 1798
  * Along with Greater Syria
  * Brought Egypt into global politics
  * Woefully unprepared for the battle
* British take over three years later
  * Defeats show a position of decline and weakness

# Egypt before, under, after colonialism

## Under colonialism

* British curtail military and industrial development in 1840
  * In part, out of fear of Egypt's success
  * Treaty stops war industry
  * Removed tariffs, prevented economic advancement
  * This is what colonialism often looked like: extractive
* Religious leaders supported Muhammed Ali in 1884
  * Turks could not protect Egypt against the French
  * New economic, educational, and political systems ("modern")
  * Limited by colonial power
* Occupied by the British in 1882
  * British assumed control over administrative functions

---

# Egypt before, under, after colonialism

## Toward independence

* Declared a protectorate in 1914 (World War I)
  * Formalized administrative control
* Resistance fueled by Islamic thought, anti-colonial sentiment, and a desire for modernization
	* Eventually symbolized by the Muslim Brotherhood (late 1920s)
  * Reimagining Islam in the modern world
  * Direct opposition of British in the Canal Zone and Palestine
  * Overshadowed by "strand of radicalism" "prone to erupt in violence"
* Unstable independence in 1922 under British influence
	* Overthrown in a coup in 1952
  * Led by Gamal Abdel Nassar, became president in 1954

# Mass media

* Commercial recording begins in the early 1900s
  * Films begin shortly after (not unlike in American pop culture)
  * 1920s, small radio stations popping up

# Music in film

* Biggest stars of the day
  * **Umm Kulthum** appeared in six films that featured seven to nine of her songs each from 1936-47
	* "ever young looking heartthrob, the suave and gentle in character **Abd al-Halim Hafiz**"
	* "ruggedly handsome, square-jawed and deep-voiced **Farid al-Atrash**" (from Syria, composer who only sang his own work)
	* **Asmahan** "who provided considerable competition to Umm Kulthum" until her 1944 death, Farid al-Atrash's sister
	* **Muhammad Abd al-Wahhab**: six films, only played his own music
	* **Fayza Ahmad**, **Warda al-Jaza'iriyya**, **Sabah**
* Clear link to film (Hafiz was in 16 films, Atrash was in 31)

* Developed form taqtuqa
  * Strophic form of alternating verses and choruses (AAAAA)
  * Later used distinct verse melody (ABABA)
* Ughniya features a different melody for each verse
  * ABACADA
* Added a muqaddima (introduction)
  * Replacing the samaʿi/dulab
  * Abd al-Wahhab expand these into stand-alone pieces
* As the genre expends, it resembles a complete wasla
  * Composers played with this relationship

---

# Role of the composer

* Unlike the wasla, an ughniyya was a single work
  * Changes may be related to music industry and rights ownership 
  * Reflects the rise in importance of the composer in Europe during the 19th century
* Solos continued, but were often written or outlined
	* Composers asserting dominance
* Changing ensemble
  * 1930s: shift from takht to firqa
  * 1970s: added bongos, tabla, electric guitar, accordion, etc
* Style changed, too
  * Heterophony influenced by new style, ensemble
  * Small group heterophony (riternello) still present
  * Education increasingly through government institutions
  * Staff notation became a norm (though not for Kulthum)

---

# Tarab and the role of the performer

* Tarab, engaging the audience
  * Required a great deal of flexibility
* Could repeat sections, return to previous moments
	* Complexity does not mean strict forms
	* Points of excitement, signs of interactivity
  * This is not a "pristine" music, but a performative one
	* Listen to vocal entrance of "Aruh Li Min"

### "Enta Umri" ([full recording on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5bIk9zH8KY))

*Your eyes took me back to the days that are gone  
They taught me to regret the past and its wounds  
What I have seen, before I have seen you, was a wasted life  
How could they consider that part of my life?  
With your light, the dawn of my life began  
How much of my life before you was lost?  
It is a wasted past, my love.  
My heart never saw happiness before you  
My heart never saw anything in life other than the taste of pain and suffering  
I started to love my life only now  
And I started to worry that my life would run away from me  
and so on*
