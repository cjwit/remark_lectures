# Egypt before, under, after colonialism

## Before colonialism

* Annexed by the Ottomans in 1516-17
  * al-Azhar in Cairo was a religious and education center
  * Gave authority across the region
* Conquered by Napoleon in 1798
  * Along with Greater Syria
  * Brought Egypt into global politics
  * Woefully unprepared for the battle
* British take over three years later
  * Defeats show a position of decline and weakness

# Egypt before, under, after colonialism

## Under colonialism

* British curtail military and industrial development in 1840
  * In part, out of fear of Egypt's success
  * Treaty stops war industry
  * Removed tariffs, prevented economic advancement
  * This is what colonialism often looked like: extractive
* Religious leaders supported Muhammed Ali in 1884
  * Turks could not protect Egypt against the French
  * New economic, educational, and political systems ("modern")
  * Limited by colonial power
* Occupied by the British in 1882
  * British assumed control over administrative functions

# Egypt before, under, after colonialism

## Toward independence

* Declared a protectorate in 1914 (World War I)
  * Formalized administrative control
* Resistance fueled by Islamic thought, anti-colonial sentiment, and a desire for modernization
	* Eventually symbolized by the Muslim Brotherhood (late 1920s)
  * Reimagining Islam in the modern world
  * Direct opposition of British in the Canal Zone and Palestine
  * Overshadowed by "strand of radicalism" "prone to erupt in violence"
* Unstable independence in 1922 under British influence
	* Overthrown in a coup in 1952
  * Led by Gamal Abdel Nassar, became president in 1954

  * Films begin shortly after (not unlike in American pop culture)
  * 1920s, small radio stations popping up
* Egyptian national radio in 1934

# Music in film

* Biggest stars of the day
  * **Umm Kulthum** appeared in six films that featured seven to nine of her songs each from 1936-47
	* "ever young looking heartthrob, the suave and gentle in character **Abd al-Halim Hafiz**"
	* "ruggedly handsome, square-jawed and deep-voiced **Farid al-Atrash**" (from Syria, composer who only sang his own work)
	* **Asmahan** "who provided considerable competition to Umm Kulthum" until her 1944 death, Farid al-Atrash's sister
	* **Muhammad Abd al-Wahhab**: six films, only played his own music
	* **Fayza Ahmad**, **Warda al-Jaza'iriyya**, **Sabah**
* Clear link to film (Hafiz was in 16 films, Atrash was in 31)
