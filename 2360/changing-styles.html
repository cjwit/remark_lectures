### NAO Takht Ensemble with Ghada Derbas: "Il-Wardi Gameel"

# Expansion of the takht

* 1930s, incorporating more violins, adding cellos and other instruments
  *	Firqa is largely a violin/bowed string sound, unlike the qanun/ʿud heavy takht
  *	Still taught by ear, not worried about bowings

* More details on this next time…
  *	Example: Sabah Fakhri with firqa
  * Note instruments, ornamentations, male chorus
  * Can you hear the quarter tone "tonic"?

Al-ʿInaya Sudaf (Being Cared for is by Chance) (10:00)
From UCSB: D - - T D - T - - D T -
Being looked after/cared for is by chance in the hidden things of the days and the given things are granted without the perseverance of the feet [not because of one’s hard work]
He who knows, knows; and he who is ignorant will blame [others] Don’t count on other than the people of honesty
The awake/attentive/vigilant God has given, and the almighty God has prohibited and thus the brain is confused
You will not attain higher states by intelligence and glory God makes happy whomever he wants, and makes miserable whomever he wants
Ya Ma Asʿad is-Subhiyya (O how happy is the morning)
Masmudi
O how happy is the morning with the rise of the dawn, with it the sun quenches the thirst of the pearly planets O, O, O, O, by God, I can’t sleep all night
Get up and play, it is suitable for you that I slaughter a ram sheep for you I will become a shepherd for you and I will herd the sheep with [my] staff
Get up and play, and quench [my thirst] Your breasts are [like] cup[s] of china O girl, why don’t you listen to me Now it’s a time of freedom
O master, be tender with me, have mercy with the one so taken, so taken with love; there is no cure and the heart is confused, confused
If you don’t return to me, promise me because desertion is something that wears one down O you who are as beautiful as Joseph, my sadness[es] is like that of Jacob [who is mourning the loss of his son Joseph]
Ya Hwayda Lak
Chorus: slow maqsum
Verse: malfuf
Ya hwayda to you, Ya hwayda to me, ah, may God help he who is suffering
O, O my, she cut it; the girl cut her hair She went to her father and insisted “I don’t want an ignorant grey haired me” [one who acts less than his age]
O, O my, from them, most of my suffering is from them By sword I will take their daughter and leave for my family’s village [encampment]
O, O my, from the girls, most of my suffering is from the girls Their saliva is the sugar of sugar cane, it heals the one who is sick, the one who is in crisis
Dumik Dum (Your Always)
Malfuf
Dumik, dumik, dumik, dum On the lap of the precious one, I become sleepy You promised me but you didn’t come and sleep flew away from my eyes
I wish I were a green meadow and the ghazal [the beloved] would come and graze and the dew would fall [rain] on me and spring would come again
I wish I were an aromatic flower [geranium?] in the window above Hopefully [every time] my beloved passes by he will answer my greetings [say hello back to me]
