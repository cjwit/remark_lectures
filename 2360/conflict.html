# About this presentation

* Not much music
* Drawn largely from William Cleveland's: *History of the Modern Middle East*
* Historical context, not much in the way of opinion

## What this is not:

* Samuel Huntington's "clash of civilizations"
* These conflicts come out of social, economic, and political realities

---

# Sunni/Shia

## Question of succession following the Rightly Guided Caliphs

* Following Uthman's murder in 656
* Ali was the cousin of the Prophet and his son in law (via Fatima), a dedicated early convert
	* Some saw him as the obvious choice
* Muʿawiyah, a Syrian governor, contested Ali's rule
* 657's Battle of Siffin: inconclusive
	* Support for Ali dwindled until he was killed in 661
	* Remembered as a "communal leader directly descended from the family of the Prophet"

---

# Later Shiʿa distinctions

* Understood all future (Sunni) leaders as usurpers
* Fundamental difference in understanding of what leadership entails (partly because of this history)
* (Sunni leader) Muʿawiyah ensured that his son Yazid would be his successor, leading to an era of dynastic rule (which we talked about before), moved the capital to Damascus
* Ali's remaining followers convinced Husayn (Ali's son) to lead a rebellion against Yazid
	* Attempt to fight secular trends in Syrian courts
	* Remembered as a martyr against tyranny, Karbala (Iraq) became an important site of veneration

---

# Shi'a Leadership

* Later Shiʿa imams had little political access, but were spiritual leaders
	* Like contemporary popes, in a way
* Twelver: twelfth leader was "hidden" by God, awaited as the Mahdi (Messianic)
	* Speaking for this lack of authority became important in Iranian revolutionary politics
	* Seveners/Ismaʿilis disagree over another stage of descent and have a current imam
	* Was influential in American cultural politics with the Nation of Islam and Ahmadis of Black US communities in the 1960s
* Leads to much contemporary  sectarian violence:
	* Iran/Iraq wars in the 1980s, Lebanese civil war, Syrian civil war

---

# Crusades

## Seljuk, Turkish forces invade up into Europe

* Cause substantial fear during a period of relative political chaos in Europe

## A time of European political unification

* Under Pope Urban during the Middle Ages in the face of a common enemy
* provided opportunity for unlanded gentry (second sons) to stake a claim to new kingdoms
* Lasted about 200 years

---

# Crusades

---

# Crusades and Orientalism

* European fear continued through Ottoman times, provoked Orientalism
* Sense of fear and representation that tell us more about ourselves than the other... (but that's another story)
* European successes largely came from a similar unstable political system and local rivalries, in the Holy Land region

## Overall, more influential on European identity than Middle Eastern

* Established a relationship of conflict and imaginary representations of each other

---

# Contemporary conflicts: Iraq and ISIS

## In case of ISIS/Al-Qaida news

* US supported Ba'athist party (Hussein) in the 1980s
	* During the Iraq-Iran war
	* Following 1979 Iranian revolution's overthrow of the Shah
* US history of supporting secular strongmen
	* Egypt's Mubarak
	* Shah in Iran
	* Tunisia's Ben Ali

## Hussein's use of religion (despite secularist history)

# Contemporary conflicts: Iraq and ISIS

## Iraq was a Sunni dominated Shi'a majority country

* Fall of the Ba'athist party put Shi'a back in power
* Quickly consolidated and left the (Sunni) ex-military with nothing

## ISIS grew, in part, out of this residual Sunni expertise and overall frustration/mistrust of Shi'a power

* This enabled quick spread across Sunni areas

---

# Israel/Palestine: context

* British mandate of Palestine was about the size of Massachusets
* One of the most difficult political and social questions of the last 100 years
	* Demonstrates the impossibility of dealing with massive injustice, structural violence in a world of nationalism
	* And the power of organization and access (and the points where those things falter)
	* And the links between domestic and foreign politics in the face of conflict
* A small space populated by one group was given to another to create a national homeland (whatever that means)
	* The efforts to create this safe space leads to one of the worlds most lasting conflicts as two groups claim a single (small) piece of land

---

# Zionism

* Historical and religious claims to the Holy Land (Zion)
	* Especially among Jewish communities experiencing systematic racism in Europe and elsewhere  (this is well before WWII)
	* Legally enshrined Anti-Semitism in many places (lack of access to some professions, universities, certain residences, and government employment, for example, especially in Eastern Europe and Russia)
	* Gained a political voice in the late 1800s
* Jewish nationalism and a lack of a Jewish nation make Jews outsiders
	* Herzl contends that the answer is a Jewish state where identity and sovereignty could coincide (though he didn't note Palestine)
	* Recognized the need for a major world power to support the idea, but could not gain that support before his death in 1904

---

# Balfour Declaration

* Ottomans entered WWI on the losing side 
	* Were divided up by Britain, France, and Russia
* British declared Palestine to be a "national home for the Jewish people"
	* For political reasons during the war, Britain had reason to support a Jewish homeland
	* Feared that the Germans would support a Jewish homeland, bring US to their side because of growing Jewish influence in US
	* Important Jewish activists had access to British government officials
	* Also, British wanted to keep French away from Suez
* Approved by the cabinet and signed on November 2, 1917

---

# British Mandate

## The problems lay in the conflicting interests... And the seeds of distrust

* Agreements were made with the Syrian leader at the time, but once the French took that land, it nullified those terms
* Britain shifted their military occupation to civilian leadership by 1920 (three years after Balfour)
	* League of Nations solidified the mandate and added to it by making Hebrew the official language, for example

---

# Creating a Jewish "national home"

* What's that mean? Is it an independent Jewish state?
	* Zionists firmly believed so
	* But 85% of the population was Arab

## White Paper (1922)

* Jewish home did not mean the imposition of Jewish nationality (whatever that means)
* But Palestine "should become a center in which the Jewish people as a whole could take pride on the grounds of religion and race" (Cleveland 228) (whatever that means)

---

# Local governance and administration

* A series of attempts to create a representative government by the British failed when Arabs boycotted their participation
	* Resulted in an administrative colonial state, increasing hostility between the two communities (neither trusted the British)
	* Two populations grew their own governmental organizations; Jewish one was more effective, Arab leadership suffered internal conflicts through previously existing rivalries
* Even though there were disagreements within the Zionist movement, they were largely cohesive
	* Arab elites often acted like colonized elites elsewhere: multiple interests that were in conflict with each other
* Plus, the Jewish Agency had far more access to British administration
	* British discounted and often ignored fractured Palestinian leadership (perhaps because they boycotted?)

---

# Histadrut: labor and militia

* 1920 on: trade union increased the organizational efficacy of the Jewish population
	* Trained future leaders, controlled wide range of industries including banking, construction, shipping
	* Boycotted Arab workers and products to support Jewish population
* Controlled militia-like defense force against Arab attacks
	* Stole weapons from the British, but they were never shut down
* Fused with another organization to create an early version of the dominant political party
	* Held power for decades after Israel became an independent state
* Other organizations sprang up internationally, including in the United States, and funded many of these activities
	* The issue is maintaining its international importance

---

# Immigration

* Arabs were fighting to maintain/gain legal control of land, Zionists were fighting for a Jewish national home (as stated in the Balfour declaration)
	* Both were still faulting the British for failing to uphold part of that agreement
* One Zionist strategy was to increase immigration
	* To lay a stronger claim to the land
	* After WWI, 30,000 came to Palestine (up to 90,000)
	* From 1924-6, another 50,000 came, mostly from Poland
	* With the rise of Hitler in 1933, this increased to 170,000 (1933-6), but this last group was different, not explicitly ideological and they brought more wealth (left as a last resort)
* Land ownership came from purchases from many Arab elites
	* Led to the expulsion of Arab tenant farmers and an increase in poverty (and the resistance movements)

---

# 1930s: white paper(s)

* With violent protests more and more common, the British sent a pair of committees to develop plans
	* Both suggested curtailing Jewish immigration, among other things
	* After political pressure from Jewish communities in Britain and the US, British government did not follow its suggestions
* The "black letter" turning back on the "white letter" led to another phase of Arab resistance
	* Pressures of unemployment and the global depression contributed
	* More violence back and forth
* By 1938, a good portion of the country was under the control of Arab rebels
	* Were turning away from moderate leadership
	* This is also when the *kufiyya* became a Palestinian symbol
	* British could not regain control until the next year, after thousands had died

---

# Another white paper in 1939

* With WWII coming, Britain decided to placate the increasingly involved new Arab states
	* Severely limited Jewish immigration to 15,000 for a few years before ending completely, while also allowing for 25,000 refugees
* During WWII
	* Jewish community fought alongside the British against Germany
	* Their militias comprised a "Jewish battalion" in Italy, continued their training in British methods
	* Opposed (and planned a war with) Britain on terms of the new white paper, to start after the European war ended

---

# World War II and the Holocaust

## Changing global attitudes

* More support for settling survivors (for obvious reasons)
* By 1942, this coalesced into the Biltmore Program
	* Set of resolutions adopted during a US Zionist meeting
	* Supported open immigration and the creation of a Jewish commonwealth
	* Found support in Truman's presidency and campaign (through 1948), signaled the move of Zionist activity to the US
	* Also showed the growing importance of a Zionist lobby within the Democratic party and humanitarian concerns

---

# Toward independence, Jewish state

* Nationalists outside of the mainstream moved to push the British out
	* Mainstream wanted to wait until the war ended
	* Included terrorist activities in the mid-1940s
* Britain passed the issue to the UN
	* Sent a committee to figure out what to do
	* Decided to pursue a two-state solution

---

---

# Toward independence, Jewish state

* Plan embraced by Zionists, rejected by Arab leaders
	* Palestinian Arab largely left out of the negotiations (in part because the British had removed much of their leadership)
	* US and other world leaders pushed to pass the two-state map through
	* Leaders of other Arab states pledged military support to Palestinians, rejected any compromise
	* Britain refused to help transition and was largely absent
* During this period, Jewish fighters claimed the lands that were designated for the Jewish state
	* Most were still Arab
	* This was the militia that was trained alongside the British in WWII
	* 400,000 Palestinians fled and nationalists escalated, trading atrocities (massacres, terrorism, etc)

---

# Toward independence, Jewish state

* On May 14, 1948, the British sail from Haifa and David Ben-Gurion announced the independent state of Israel
* On May 15, 1948, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Transjordan, and Iraq invade
	* It was poorly coordinated and the well-trained and larger (30,000 to 21,000) Israeli army won by the end of the year
	* This, thanks in part to a cease fire during which that militia nearly doubled in size
	* The partition plan was no longer viable
	* Palestine ended up split between Egypt, Israel, and Jordan

---

# Following 1948

* Refugees of crisis (during the period before 1948) became permanent
	* 700,000 end up in Syria, Egypt, and (mostly) Jordan
	* Haganah solidified these gains through "Plan D": "provided for the conquest and permanent occupation, or leveling, of Arab villages and towns" (Benny Morris)
	* Only 160,000 Palestinian Arabs remained in Israel by the end of 1949 (down from nearly a million earlier)
* Results
	* This largely became a substitution of one refugee crisis for another
	* Forced the Arab world to reconsider itself within a post-colonial global reality

# Later conflicts

* Suez Crisis in 1956 with Gamal Abd al-Nassar
	* Nassar had recently nationalized the canal, this attempt was to reclaim it, failed under foreign pressure
* Six-Day War in 1967
	* Egypt, Jordan, and Syria
	* Unclear as to the series of events (Egypt brought forces to the border, pre-emptive attacks on Egyptian airfields)
	* Massive success by the Israeli forces (returned to earlier borders afterwards due to foreign pressure)
