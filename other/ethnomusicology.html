# Ethnomusicology as anthropology

## Embedded within the field's history

* Born of anthropology more so than musicology
* Developed out of comparative efforts pre-1950, "armchair" work

---

# Ethnomusicology as anthropology

## Heavy focus on fieldwork

* Going somewhere and doing something
* Focus on primary experience, documents, interviews, participant observation
* Allows for diverse theoretical approaches that include sound studies, phenomenology
* Under scrutiny: What is the field? Whose knowledge counts? What are the colonial legacies?

---

# Scope of the field

## Big questions

* How do people use music?
  * How do they give it meaning?
  * What do they do?
* What can musical practice tell us about people?
  * How does it reflect society?
  * How does it illuminate people's choices?
  * How can it help us to understand communities, histories, and so on?

---

# Scope of the field
  
## Wide breadth

* This questions are applicable to anyone, anywhere
* Opens space for historical ethnomusicology, computational analysis, archival research
* Provides tools to understand politics, social structure, identity, religion, ideology, aesthetics, history and memory, and so on

---

# Methodologies

## Interdisciplinary approaches

* The field is open to diverse ways to answer diverse questions about diverse musics
* Draws from anthropology, musicology, music theory/analysis, geography, data science, sociology, history, poetry, choreography, and any other field across campus

---

# Methodologies

## Fieldwork

* Asking for real people to answer real questions
* Working in communities for longer periods of time to understand musical activities and social experiences
* Comprised of interviews, observation, participation, building long-standing relationships, lessons/performance, collaboration, and generally experiencing "research" or "the field" in a personal and specific way: helps to avoid overgeneralization
* Has a tendency to link ethnomusicology to specific area studies, but that is not a necessary result
