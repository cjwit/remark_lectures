# What is "public"? And "speaking"?

## A chance to introduce myself

* Major conferences
* Musical performances
* Teaching
* Ethnographic research

--

## Empowering... and disempowering

* Persuasion, confidence, nerves, fear, vulnerability

---

# What is "public"? And "speaking"?

## Where is "public"?

* On stage?
* On the street?
* In a group of friends?
* In a group of strangers?

--

## Public speaking is about relationships and interrelationships

---

# A brief overview

* Audience
* Style
* Preparation
* Practice
* And speaking

--

## Notice that very little of this is about speaking

# Who are you talking to?

## Speaking of audiences...

* Who am I talking to?
* Memorable presntations
* Memorably terrible presentations
* Why? What stands out from these?

### A memorable one of for me: [The danger of a single story, by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie](https://www.ted.com/talks/chimamanda_ngozi_adichie_the_danger_of_a_single_story/up-next)

---

# What's the point?

## Why are you taking up these people's time?

* Do the work that you mean to do
* What are you trying to get done?
* It's your job to get them listening
* What do they know already?

--

## What are your experiences with public speaking? What are you hoping to get from this?

---

# What are you going to say?

* Write out your words
* Read your words out loud
* Change your words (over and over)
* Make notes to yourself
* Then you can ignore your words

--

## Other exercises

* Elevator talk
* Talk to a kid

---

# Slides

## Can be super helpful

* Don't write sentences
* Don't read from the screen
* Support the talk, they are not the talk

--

## Should serve a purpose

* In this case: slides are a reference
* And I should have pictures

# (Hopefully) useful practice ideas

* Talk to the  mirror: what are your "ticks"?
* Record yourself: do you sound natural?
* Practice with friends and family: let them be honest

## My comments

* Slow down
* Can the back row hear you?

---

# Go time

* Test your equipment
* Have backups... of everything

## Have fun!

* Look up
* Walk around
* Laugh
* Breathe
* End on time
