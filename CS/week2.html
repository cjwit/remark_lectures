# Research questions

### "In the beginning, there was waterfall [...] All was not well." (70)

* An iterative experiment
  * The XP process is the experiment, as described in the conclusions
  * Sidebar testimonials provide the results

* Questions
  * How to avoid pitfalls of waterfall to reduce the cost of big changes?

### These questions bleed into...

---

# Motivation

* Customers contradict themselves
  * Change their mind
  * Requirements may be vague or unknown

* Big changes late in the process are expensive
  * How to avoid early decisions and commitments
  * How to leverage other advances like modular programming, information hiding, etc.

---

# Main theory

### Put the waterfall in the blender (70)

### Comparing the waterfall, iterative (spiral, and XP processes)]

---

# Main theory

* Present a comprehensive software engineering process and (physical) environment
  * Detailed components in sidebar on page 71
* Development cycle based on user stories that are
  * business-oriented (customer priorities)
  * testable
  * estimable
* Focus
  * Customer priorities
  * Social aspect of development/team cohesion (includes specific details like pair programming and open workspaces)
  * Clear and frequent iterations

---

# Tests

* Determined by the customer in frequent meetings
  * Based on what "would convince them that the stories for an iteration are complete" (74)
* Coded first
  * Implementation depends on balance between "clean" or "ugly" options
  * When going "ugly," save refactoring opportunity for future iterations
* Pair programming is central
  * Alleviates difficulty of testing your own code
* Automated testing builds confidence over time

---

# How XP handles problems

* Underestimation, uncooperative customers
  * Unsurprisingly, requires "lots of practice estimating" (75)
  * XP prioritizes communication: solve the problem internally (locate issues in the process), then communicate
  * System is fully dependent on trust both within the team and with the customer
* Turnover: pair programming and testing
  * No one exclusively knows "secrets" (76)
  * New members can work with experienced ones to learn the system
  * Testing prevents unfamiliar new team members from breaking things
  * Discussion of team and fit: "XP is an intensely social activity, and not everyone can learn it." (76)

---

# Conclusions

### "XP is by no means a finished, polished idea."

* Development process itself is iterative...
  * Regarding changing requirements: earlier versions of XP planned releases in advance, this version prioritizes stories at each iteration (more flexibility)
* Limits are not clear, but trying XP requires courage
* Presents a strategy of adopting pieces for the "worst problem in your current process"
  * Then do it again (iterate)

# Thoughts and future work

* Obviously influential since 1999: Agile, TDD, etc.
* Assumes a certain social life around development and customer interaction
  * Accounts for customers not being oracles
  * Defines practice (pair programming, TDD) and environment (open) that may have hard limits
  * Requiring flexibility is something of a paradox
* The anthropologist in me asks:
  * How has this impacted things like government contracts/classified work? 
  * What about when extreme differences exist in one company's projects (like Google)?
