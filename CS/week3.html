# Research questions

* How does software evolve?
  * And how can we better understand it?
  * What is evolution (vs. maintenance), anyhow?

## Motivation

* Change is embedded within social and technical environments
  * Includes price, usability, security, so on
  * Past work (Lehman's laws, Swanson's taxonomy) inform rethinking, need evaluation

---

# History lessons

* Maintenance vs. evolution
  * Review Swanson's terminologies (corrective, adaptive, perfective), inclusion of preventive
* Evolution involves change: "innovation, not preservation"
  * And the change is *essential*
  * Review's Lehman's laws, notes that some deserve more study (8, feedback), others may change over time (3, 4, 5)
* Introduces Bennett and Rajlich's *Staged Model*
  * initial development
  * active evolution
  * servicing
  * phase out

# Science lessons

* Genotype vs. phenotype
  * Source code vs. executable program
* Individual vs. population
  * Software vs. all versions of software
* Evolution happens in a changing environment
* Unlike biology, software has clear intelligent design
  * People, responding to environment 
  * External pressures can encourage or discourage change (market, legal, etc.)

# Main theory

## Six sets of challenges and opportunities

1. Model building and empirical studies
  * Challenges relate to closed systems, software diversity, changing environments
  * How can we better understand these?
  * Empirical studies are "the cornerstone"

2. Open source development
  * Empirical study allows for reproducibility
  * Can we extrapolate about proprietary systems?
  * Hybrid systems (proejcts managed by organizations) may be helpful

# Main theory

## Six sets of challenges and opportunities

3. Evolutionary pressures and emergent design
  * How much can we reasonably expect to predict?
  * Evolution is opportunistic, which is hard to plan
  * Focuses on negatives (like dependencies), also hard to plan

4. Improving collective memory
  * Need for better tools and practices related to history
  * Documenters: "historians of the system" focused on evolution
  * Chicken/egg regarding value of this work

# Main theory

## Six sets of challenges and opportunities

5. Emergence of software "ecospheres"
  * Growth of service-oriented archetectures across organizations
  * Modularity brings issues of dependencies, changes, updates
  * Requires thinking ecologically rather than in isolation

6. Understanding of economic tradeoffs, risks
  * Development requires judgment about risks and costs
  * Not just management: copy-paste (cloning) example
  * Why are people and organizations making their choices?

---

# Conclusions and thoughts

* Research on evolution is still new
  * How can a model address complexity?
  * How can it address environment?
  * How to best represent Lehman's feedback?

* Demonstrated need for new methodologies
  * Qualitative to inform the quantitative
  
* Potential for substantial insight in decision-making
  * Recognition of the management and developer decisions that inform evolution
