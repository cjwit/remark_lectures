# Western Models as Limitations and Bias in Music Analysis Tool Design

## Christopher Witulski

---

# About music, motivations

* Exists as sound, live or recorded
* Holds semantic meaning based in traditions

## The problem: bias in theory/analysis methods

* Based in Western tradition
* Organized around European notation and conceptualizations
* Prioritize some values and erase others
* Embed bias and limit analytical potential

---

# Research questions

* Connecting music theory discourses to computational tools
  * How we conceptualize musical value... and encode it
  * Framed as motivation for a larger action research project
  * From analysis to critical theory research to a tool presentation

--
* RQ1: How do computational systems conceptualize and represent musical knowledge?
* RQ2: How do software design choices (including data representation and system architecture) enable or limit computational analysis?
* RQ3: How are researchers adapting system designs to address evolving user needs/requirements and technical capabilities?

# Music processing and analysis

* Methods and software as tools
  * They do not interpret meaning, users do
* Some approaches to music analysis and example tasks
  * Signal processing (considering music as sound): Recording, playback, audio synthesis
  * Music information retrieval (describing the sound, feature extraction): Determining melodies, key areas; higher-level analysis related to genre, mood, perception
  * Orthography (notating music): Composition and transcription, graphical representation of music as a score or other form of visualization
  * Computational analysis (music theory): Pattern recognition and corpus analysis
  * Metadata analysis: "big data"-oriented approaches to usage statistics or similar, combined with MIR or other information (discussed separately in the paper)

# Software design and representing music

## Two common tools: Humdrum and music21

* Demonstrate standard techniques
* Depend on conceptual models based in Western history
* Incorporate flexibility while maintaining limitations

---

# Humdrum

* Developed by David Huron, Ohio State University
* Pipe and filter architecture
  * Toolkit designed to work alongside UNIX commands
  * Imports, manipulates, and exports text data
  * Chaining tools together allows for flexibility
* Representation in text files
  * Vertical columns (spines) encode voices
  * TSV format allows for other information (like performance data)
  * Extensive flexibility for metadata
  * Often uses `**kern` as a standard

# music21

* Developed by Michael Cuthbert's team at MIT
* Object oriented architecture
  * Embeds musical concepts and analytical functionality into nested class objects
  * Replicates hierarchical conceptual models of Western music
  * Music has melodies that have notes that have pitches
* Python library
  * Allows for data processing, visualization using other Python tools
  * Extensive parsers (14% of LOC) and included corpora (80% of LOC)

---

# music21 

```python
for i in range(len(notes) - 1):
    n1 = notes[i]
    n2 = notes[i + 1]
    thisInt = interval.Interval(n1, n2)
    print(thisInt.directedNiceName)
# Returns:
# Ascending Minor Third
# Descending Major Second
# Descending Minor Second
```

# Signal processing approaches

* Tools that operate on the sound itself
  * MIR techniques, extensive plugin systems
  * Research on where musically meaningful content is within the sound
  * Includes pitch detection, rhythmic analysis, timbre
  * Still largely connected to Western ideas in how they connect to other tools or are used by researchers and software developers

# Conclusions and future work

* Discussion of efforts to overcome these limitations
  * Architectural designs focused on usability, changing understandings of user requirements
  * Efforts to encode more rich data into system design (movement, performance, etc.)
  * Incorporations of interactive analysis systems
  * Use of machine learning and Big Data approaches to discover new relationships

--
* Future work: interdisciplinary and inclusive architectures
  * Using automatic music transcription with ethnographically-derived conceptions of Middle Eastern improvisation
  * Using signal processing, structuring orthographic meaning through decision making systems that are determined by and useful to Middle Eastern music practitioners
  * Connecting these systems to the values of the traditions being analyzed
