# Research questions

* How can we better represent source code structure visually?
* How can we maximize comprehension when visualizing metrics and software hierarchy?

--

## Motivating factors

* Software systems are complex and nested
* Software metrics are quantitative abstractions
* Software visualization creates representations and can focus on relational structures, combine metrics, etc.

---

# Hierarchy visualizations

* Adapting Treemaps to enable meaningful representation of metrics
* Limits of rectangular geometry hinder readability
* Difficult to represent relationships with boundaries

# Proposed system

* Using arbitrary and compact polygons facilitates readability
  * Boundaries can better show relationships
* Approximations and sampling alleviate computational issues
* Color, transparency, and text labels can add metric information

# Process

* Automatic hierarchy extraction from OO source code
* Computation of Voronoi tessellations
  * Iterative and potentially costly process
  * Numeric instead of an analytical approach
* Build polygons from curves
  * Find curves between adjacent circles
  * Select the curves relevant to the polygons
  * Clip them to the polygons' borders to create shapes

---

# Additional user-centric adaptations

* Allowing user interaction
  * Interactivity through zooming
  * Ability to explore data

# Additional user-centric adaptations

* Information hiding and scoping
  * Using increasing transparency to visually render hierarchy
  * Lower levels are less opaque or hidden
  * Ability to animate according or adjust based on a transparency threshold

# Conclusions and future work

* Future goals
  * Develop alternative and more efficient algorithms
  * Integrate into a software analysis environment

* Thoughts
  * Powerful use of visualization, allows for multidimensional analysis
  * Like any visualization (or representation or metric), limited by clarity and creativity of the analyst
  * How have the authors found this to be useful? What observations did it allow and what changes did it catalyze?
