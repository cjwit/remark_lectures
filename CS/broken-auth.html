# Broken Authentication

## Software Weaknesses, CS 6310

## Given by Christopher Witulski

---

# Description of the weakness(es)

* Collection of weaknesses allowing impersonation
  * Session management
  * Credential management

* Attack types range broadly
  * Credential stuffing
  * Impersonating sessions

* Responsible for many high-profile attacks
  * Now included in OWASP Top 10

---

# Potential impacts

* Widespread because of design and implementation flaws
* Broad range
  * Due to compromised login access
* Could include:
  * Money laundering (especially in banking)
  * Social security fraud (records systems)
  * Identity theft
  * Intellectual property theft
  * Access to sensitive information/records

---

# Types of attacks: credential stuffing

* TurboTax, Disney+, Ring home cameras
* Comprise nearly half of Auth0's login requests
* From reuse of passwords
  * A form of "account takeover"
  * Initial password gained from hacked database, published database, phishing attack, etc.
  * Attackers try username/password combinations in other websites through automation
* May result in user lockout, fraudulent purchases, IP theft, and accounts being sold

---

# Similar to other password-related attacks

* Password spraying
  * Trying common and weak passwords
  * Can avoid brute-force protections by rotating user attempts instead of password attempts
* Phishing
  * Spoofing a login page to trick users into sharing credentials

---

# Types of attacks: credential stuffing 

* System approaches to mitigation:
  * Multi-factor authentication (better than password rotation)
  * Bruce force protections (limiting automated botnets, log failures)
  * Protections after password breaches (additional verification, notifications, forced password changes)
* Password-centric approaches to mitigation:
  * Require strong passwords (avoid top [10000 worst](https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Passwords), follow [evidence-based policies](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html#memsecret))
  * Avoid knowledge-based password recovery
  * Do not use default passwords
  * Hash passwords and do not store them as plain text
  * Phishing training

---

# Types of attacks: session management

* Session associates network transactions with a specific user
  * Allows tracking of activity across authenticated use periods (logins)
  * Usually held as cookies or URL parameters
* Session management relates to the definition of session parameters
  * How long before automatic log out?
  * How are session IDs issued or revoked?
  * how are they linked to a user's IP address?
* Longer sessions improve user experience, but require a balance
  * "A hijacked session ID is as strong as a stolen login credential"

---

# Types of attacks: session management

* Session hijacking: steal session IDs to impersonate users
  * Continuing a session after a user forgets to log out on a public computer
* Session ID URL rewriting: session is encoded into URL via parameters
  * Anyone who can see the URL (via insecure Wi-Fi, for example) can copy the URL and join the session
  * Led to "Zoom-bombing"
* Session fixation: using the same session ID before and after authentication
  * Attacker sends a link with a session ID that requires log in and is able to use that session after the user follows it to authenticate

---

# Types of attacks: session management

* Mitigation includes: 
  * Consider limiting session length where appropriate (depends on the domain)
  * Use strong server-side session manager
  * Rotate session IDs: create new IDs after login to prevent fixation
  * Invalidate session IDs after logout, idle, absolute timeout: prevents reuse after the conclusion of a session
  * Use cookies instead of URLs: URLs are easily exposed
  * Anomaly detection (are logins geographically distant, for example?)

---

# Examples

* Authentication and session management is difficult
  * Increasingly handled externally: FB, Google, Auth0, etc.

### FB's access token

```js
FB.getLoginStatus(function(response) {
  if (response.status === 'connected') {
    var accessToken = response.authResponse.accessToken;
  } 
});
```

### FB's logout

```js
FB.logout(function(response) {
  // user is now logged out
});
```

# Recent vulnerabilities

### Session management

* [CVE-2021-21339](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-21339): A PHP-based CMS stored session IDs as plain text. They were inaccessible directly, but could be accessed through SQL injection elsewhere in the system.
* [CVE-2020-6292](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-6292): SAP (an enterprise software company) had a system that did not invalidate session cookies.

# Recent vulnerabilities

### Credential management

* Previously mentioned major hacks
  * TurboTax, Disney+, Ring home cameras
* [CVE-2017-11743](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-11743): The MEDHOST Connex system had a hard-coded administrative credential that could not be changed, exposing patient information to anyone who knew the *hard coded* admin account password ($K8t1ng).
